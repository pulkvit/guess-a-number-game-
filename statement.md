# Problem Statement

When beginners start learning Python, they often look for simple projects that help them practice core programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, functions, and handling user input. A number-guessing game is a great choice because it is interactive and encourages logical thinking.  
This project focuses on creating a Python game where both the player and the computer can take turns guessing numbers, making the learning experience more fun and engaging.

# Scope of the Project

This project includes two different game modes:

1. **Player Guess Mode**  
   In this mode, the computer randomly selects a number, and the player tries to guess it.  
   After each guess, the player receives hints such as **"too high"** or **"too low"** to help narrow down the correct number.

2. **Computer Guess Mode**  
   In this mode, the player thinks of a number, and the computer attempts to guess it.  
   Based on the player's feedback (`h` for too high, `l` for too low, `c` for correct), the computer adjusts its guessing range until it finds the correct number.

The entire program runs in the terminal and uses only basic Python concepts. No external libraries are required other than the built-in `random` module.
