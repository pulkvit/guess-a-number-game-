Problem Statement

When beginners start learning Python, they often look for simple projects that help them practice core programming concepts like loops, conditionals, functions, and handling user input. A number-guessing game is a great choice because it's interactive and encourages logical thinking.
This project focuses on creating a Python game where both the player and the computer can take turns guessing numbers, making the learning experience more fun and engaging.

Scope of the Project

The project includes two different game modes:

Player Guess Mode
In this mode, the computer randomly chooses a number, and the player tries to guess it. After each guess, the player receives hints to help narrow it down.

Computer Guess Mode
Here, the player thinks of a number, and the computer tries to guess it. Based on the player’s feedback (too high, too low, or correct), the computer adjusts its guesses.

Everything runs in the terminal, and the project uses only basic Python—no extra libraries are needed besides the built-in random module.
